## What is this project?

This is a hospital management system I built for managing appointments between doctors and patients. It has three types of users:
- **Admin** - Manages doctors and patients
- **Doctors** - View appointments and update treatment records
- **Patients** - Book appointments and view medical history

## Why I made this

Most hospitals still use paper registers or complicated software. I wanted to make something simple that:
- Lets patients book appointments online
- Helps doctors see their schedule easily
- Gives admins control over everything
- Keeps all medical records in one place

## Features

### For Patients
- Register and login
- Book appointments (choose doctor, date, time slot)
- View appointment history
- See treatment records (diagnosis, medicines prescribed)
- Cancel appointments

### For Doctors
- View today's appointments
- See assigned patients
- Update treatment details (diagnosis, prescription, notes)
- Mark appointments as completed
- Set availability (morning/evening slots for next 7 days)

### For Admin
- Add/edit/blacklist doctors
- Edit/blacklist patients
- View all appointments
- Reschedule or cancel any appointment
- See appointment history for any doctor or patient
- Dashboard with statistics

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Vue.js 3 (loaded from CDN)
- Bootstrap 5 for styling
- Professional dark theme (#0f172a)

**Backend:**
- Python Flask
- SQLite database
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- JWT for authentication

**Background Jobs:**
- Celery (for sending emails)
- Redis (message broker)

## How to Run

### Quick Start (Just 2 steps!)

1. **Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed_db.py          # Creates database with sample data
python app.py              # Starts server at http://localhost:5000
```

2. **Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000  # Opens at http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Login Credentials

After running `seed_db.py`, you can login as:

**Admin:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

**Doctors:**
- Username: `dr_sharma` / `dr_verma` / `dr_patel` / `dr_singh` / `dr_kumar`
- Password: `doctor123`

**Patients:**
- Username: `patient1` / `patient2` / `patient3` ... (up to patient10)
- Password: `patient123`

### Optional: Email Notifications

If you want email features (appointment confirmations, reminders):

1. Install and start Redis
2. Run Celery worker
3. Run Celery beat (for scheduled tasks)

See `docs/setup.md` for detailed instructions.

## Database Tables

- **users** - Login credentials for all users
- **doctors** - Doctor profiles (name, specialization, experience, fees)
- **patients** - Patient info (name, age, gender, medical history)
- **appointments** - Booking records (date, time, status)
- **treatments** - Treatment records (diagnosis, prescription, notes)
- **doctor_availability** - Doctor schedule slots (morning/evening)
