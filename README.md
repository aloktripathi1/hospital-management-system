## What is this project?

This is a hospital management system I built for managing appointments between doctors and patients. It has three types of users:
- **Admin** - Manages doctors and patients
- **Doctors** - View appointments and update treatment records
- **Patients** - Book appointments and view medical history

## Why I made this

Most hospitals still use paper registers or complicated software. I wanted to make something simple that:
- Lets patients book appointments online
- Helps doctors see their schedule easily
- Gives admins control over everything
- Keeps all medical records in one place

## Features

### For Patients
- Register and login
- Book appointments (choose doctor, date, time slot)
- View appointment history
- See treatment records (diagnosis, medicines prescribed)
- Cancel appointments

### For Doctors
- View today's appointments
- See assigned patients
- Update treatment details (diagnosis, prescription, notes)
- Mark appointments as completed
- Set availability (morning/evening slots for next 7 days)

### For Admin
- Add/edit/blacklist doctors
- Edit/blacklist patients
- View all appointments
- Reschedule or cancel any appointment
- See appointment history for any doctor or patient
- Dashboard with statistics

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Vue.js 3 (loaded from CDN)
- Bootstrap 5 for styling
- Professional dark theme (#0f172a)

**Backend:**
- Python Flask
- SQLite database
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- JWT for authentication

**Background Jobs:**
- Celery (for sending emails)
- Redis (message broker)
